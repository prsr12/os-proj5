# os-proj5
Project 5 for operating systems
implementing deadlock detection and dealing with starvation issues

I have added a header file for this project.
The programs are running but not properly, the program is blocking all of the process requests.
Unable to figure that out as to why it is happening. I will try to work on this project again if given the chance.
